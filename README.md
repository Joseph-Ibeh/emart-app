# E-MART App (Deployed with Docker & Nginx)

This repository is a Dockerized version of an open-source e-commerce application called **E-MART**. I did not build the original app, but I cloned it to practice cloud deployment using Docker, Nginx, and AWS EC2.

- **Dockerized** the frontend (Angular), backend APIs (Node.js and Java Spring Boot), and databases (MongoDB and MySQL).

- Deployed the entire stack on **AWS EC2**.
- Configured **EC2 Security Groups** to allow access on ports `80`, `4200`, `5000`, and `9000`.
- Pushed this deployment-ready version to **GitHub** for others to clone and use.
